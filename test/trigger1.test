# This file tests creating and dropping triggers, and interaction thereof

#
# 1. CREATE and DROP TRIGGER tests
# trig-1.1: Error if table does not exist
# trig-1.2: Error if trigger already exists
# trig-1.3: Created triggers are deleted if the transaction is rolled back
# trig-1.4: DROP TRIGGER removes trigger
# trig-1.5: Dropped triggers are restored if the transaction is rolled back
# trig-1.6: Error if dropped trigger doesn't exist
# trig-1.7: Dropping the table automatically drops all triggers
# trig-1.8: A trigger created on a TEMP table is not inserted into sqlite_master
# trig-1.9: Ensure that we cannot create a trigger on sqlite_master
# trig-1.10:
# trig-1.11:
# trig-1.12: Ensure that INSTEAD OF triggers cannot be created on tables
# trig-1.13: Ensure that AFTER triggers cannot be created on views
# trig-1.14: Ensure that BEFORE triggers cannot be created on views
